=========================
 Setext Documents Mirror
=========================

Here are `local copies of some Setext documents`__, made available to
document the prehistory of the Docutils_ project (and especially the
reStructuredText_ markup).

__
.. _Setext mirror: setext/
.. _Docutils: ../
.. _reStructuredText: ../rst.html

The source for the original Setext (structure-enhanced text) documents
was http://www.bsdi.com/setext/, but it seems to have disappeared from
the Web.  The files in the "`Setext mirror`_" are all the files
relating to Setext that I have (including `a tarball of the lot`__).

__ setext/setext.tgz

I have not been able to locate the originators of Setext, Ian Feldman
or Tony Sanders.  If you know how to contact them, or if you know of
an official repository for the Setext documents, please `inform me`__.
